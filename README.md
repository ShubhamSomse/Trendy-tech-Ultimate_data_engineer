# Trendy-tech-Ultimate_data_engineer
18-week accelerated roadmap following Sumeet Mittal’s Trendy Tech Ultimate Data Engineering Program — hands-on implementation of PySpark, Databricks Lakehouse, Azure ADF, Delta Lake, Streaming (Kafka), Data Modeling, and CI/CD with real-world projects.

# 🚀 Trendy Tech Ultimate Data Engineer – Hands-On Implementation (Oct 2025 → Feb 2026)

This repository contains all my week-by-week hands-on work from the **Trendy Tech Ultimate Data Engineer Course** by Sumeet Mittal — executed on **Databricks Free Edition** and structured into an **18-week accelerated learning roadmap**.

I’m compressing the 7-month course into 4.5 months while balancing a full-time job — combining videos, hands-ons, SQL/DSA drills, and real Azure data-engineering projects.

## 🧩 Repository Structure

Each week = one folder with:
- 📒 **Databricks notebooks** for lectures’ hands-on  
- 🧠 **README.md** summarizing concepts, code snippets, and learnings  
- 📊 **Screenshots/Architecture diagrams**  
- 📘 **SQL + DSA progress logs**
