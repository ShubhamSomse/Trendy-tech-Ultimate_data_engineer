18-week accelerated roadmap following Sumeet Mittalâ€™s Trendy Tech Ultimate Data Engineering Program â€” hands-on implementation of PySpark, Databricks Lakehouse, Azure ADF, Delta Lake, Streaming (Kafka), Data Modeling, and CI/CD with real-world projects.

# ðŸš€ Trendy Tech Ultimate Data Engineer â€“ Hands-On Implementation (Oct 2025 â†’ Feb 2026)

This repository contains all my week-by-week hands-on work from the **Trendy Tech Ultimate Data Engineer Course** by Sumeet Mittal â€” executed on **Databricks Free Edition** and structured into an **18-week accelerated learning roadmap**.

Iâ€™m compressing the 7-month course into 4.5 months while balancing a full-time job â€” combining videos, hands-ons, SQL/DSA drills, and real Azure data-engineering projects.
